## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 2 notes

- I get this note on github's R-CMD check, unsure if this is an actual problem, since the vignettes does appear to be in the 'vignettes' directory:

```
Vignette sources only in ‘inst/doc’:
  ‘APackOfTheClones-primary.Rmd’, ‘APackOfTheClones-runs.Rmd’
A ‘vignettes’ directory is required as from R 3.1.0
and these will not be indexed nor checked
```

## Additional notes

- This is a new major release of the previously archived version
- All DOIs in the Package are valid.
